GitHub

1. My GitHub - https://github.com/supritism 
2. USN - ****/***

How I pushed my code from local to git repository.
<First removed all GitHubDesktop files from my Mac>
Then :
$ git --version
$ which git
$ git config --global user.name "Supriti SDE"
$ git config --global user.email "supriti.sm@gmail.com"
$ cd Desktop/GITHubProjects/
$ git add .
$ git status
$ git commit -m "My first git commit with Java"
$ git branch -M main
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:supritism/Java.git
$ git push -u origin main

Initially I did not have permission and my ssh-agent didn’t have any identities linked :
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
$ ssh-add -l -E sha256

So followed below to set-up one time:
- https://docs.github.com/pt/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

And then did a push and it worked!! 
————————————————
> Remotes represent repositories that you might have read and/or write access to.

> Note that when trying to push to a seperate created repository, you cannot use remote 'origin' as that may be already taken. 
You can see all remotes by command :
> $ git remote -v
> To remove a remote : $git remote remove <remote name>
> Rename the existing remote : $git remote rename <old-name> <new-name>

So when doing line #18, if we already have 'origin' then remove it else create a new remote with new name.
Example - git remote add test git@github.com:supritism/XYZ.git

Apart from that rest of the steps as above is valid.
